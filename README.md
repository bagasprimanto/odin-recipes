# Recipes project
This is my very first web project: creating a website consisting of separate HTML pages.

## Project Goals
By the end of this project, I will have demonstrated the following skills:
* Using HTML & its relevant HTML tags to create an HTML page
* Use HTML anchor tags to direct users to other HTML pages within my site or in an external site
* Use HTML image tags to display images
